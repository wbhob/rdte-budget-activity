A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
This Program Element (PE) funds the Army's goal of assessing and researching innovative solutions to achieve future force modernization. The Army is developing
new ways of doing business to include strategic and "non-traditional" partnerships and working with traditional vendors in novel ways to allow for agile integration of
leading-edge technology. Critical technologies that allow for technological superiority are increasingly dual-use or developed in academia-led partnerships that leverage
cutting edge innovation. In an era of global competition, technological superiority requires agile and rapid innovation. Cross-cutting modernization initiatives leverage
strategic partnerships foster an environment to bring knowledge and expertise to demonstrate breakthrough and innovative technologies that will benefit the warfighter.
These collaborations bring new ways of doing business to assess and evaluate emerging technologies with high payoff potential to address current technology shortfalls.
Leveraging other innovative mechanisms, to include accelerators, incubators, and other technology accelerants, to enhance innovation is part of the overall innovation
strategy. Innovation includes not only hardware and physical products but also software, software development, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, all as
stand-alone initiatives and as part of broader innovation to programs and technology development. Oversight includes a joint Innovation governance which requires joint
evaluation of programs that will meet the basis of Army Priorities and Army Modernization needs to inform an optimal technology investment strategy.
Work in this program element is closely coordinated with program element 0603025A (Army Agile Innovation and Demonstration).
The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.
Work is performed by the United States Army Futures Command.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
The Military Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Research Program conducts research on HIV, which causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Work
in this area includes refining improved identification methods to determine genetic diversity of the virus and evaluating and preparing overseas sites for clinical trials
with global vaccine candidates. Additional activities include refining candidate vaccines for preventing HIV and undertaking preclinical studies (studies required before
testing in humans) to assess vaccine for potential to protect and/or manage the disease in infected individuals. This project is jointly managed through an Interagency
Agreement between United States Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
(NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health.
The Combatting Antimicrobial Resistant Bacteria (CARB) research program was established in response to Presidential direction in late 2013 to create a National
Strategy to address the critical issue of antimicrobial resistance. This effort's focus is on the development of new/novel antibiotics, especially those targeting the most
resistant and worrisome Gram negative bacterial pathogens, using existing expertise at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), and leveraging other
WRAIR capabilities to evaluate viable candidate targets for advanced discovery. This project supports (both directly and indirectly) Global Health Security Agenda
priorities to respond rapidly and effectively to biological threats of international concern.
The cited work is also consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas, and supports the principal area
of Military Relevant Infectious Diseases to include HIV.

Note
Project BB9 (Human Performance Tech for Mobility & Lethality) is Terminated starting in Fiscal Year 2023 (FY23)
A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
This Program Element (PE) conducts fundamental research on Soldier Lethality technologies to develop an integrated Soldier and Squad architecture of equipment
and systems that improve Soldier and Small Combat Unit survivability, sustainability, mobility, combat effectiveness, and individual cognitive and physical readiness.
To address the challenges of integrating multiple technologies and sub-systems, research conducted in this PE, significant Science and Technology applied research
investments in all areas of Soldier Lethality, focus on how to improve the effectiveness of the technologies a Soldier utilizes and apply systems-level practices to
mitigate constraints from size and weight of the equipment. Research areas encompass individual and crew-served weapon designs and technologies as well as
applied research in lightweight and transparent armor materials to mitigate effects from blast and ballistic threats, counter explosive hazard detection, counter-sensor
capabilities, and signature management of weapons, equipment, personnel and high value targets. This PE investigates, develops and designs materials, technologies,
methodologies and system models required to experiment and optimize Soldier lethality and survivability through investments in mobility, human-agent teaming, and
improved situational awareness interfaces and display technologies as well as to provide Soldier-borne power and energy materials and components that support
multiple Soldier-borne systems. This PE also investigates Warfighter training technologies and develops the underpinning technologies to establish architecture
standards and interfaces necessary for creating realistic synthetic environments to create a single, interconnected synthetic training system to enable Army units and
leaders to conduct realistic multi-echelon / multi-domain combined arms maneuver and mission command training, increasing proficiency through repetition. Human
Factors Engineering projects conduct applied research to design weapon systems standards, guidelines, handbooks, and Soldier training curriculum and tools.
Results of these efforts are transitioned within the Army Futures Command, the Program Executive Offices, Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Army
Medical Command (MEDCOM), Human Systems Integration (HSI) Directorate (Army G1), and the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC).
Work in this PE complements PE 0603118A (Soldier Lethality Advanced Technology) / Project AZ6 (Soldier Signature Management Advanced Technology).

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
This Project advances the understanding of human augmentation and interaction for enhanced operational performance with a focus on adaptation, training, human
variability, metrics/methodologies for assessment, and task quantification. Research encompasses conducting applied research to develop metrics, measures, tools, and
techniques to quantify and understand the relationships that enable maximum effectiveness of integrated Soldier-augmentation technologies. The resulting data are the
basis for physical augmentation systems and equipment design standards, guidelines, and intelligent agent requirements to improve equipment operation and Soldiersystem synergy. Application of this research will yield reduced workload, reduced Soldier training requirements, enhanced Soldier lethality/survivability, user acceptance,
and allow Soldiers to achieve maximum performance. Major efforts explore novel techniques for Soldier assessment, characterization of individual variability effects
on performance, development of evidence-based design guidance for the application of augmentation technologies, exploration of the relationship of exoskeleton and
physical-assist device adaptation and baseline Soldier parameters such as gait, neuromuscular motor control and proprioception. This Project will also explore novel
training paradigms for reduced Soldier-augmentation technology adaptation times to address current and future warrior performance issues. Individual efforts exploit
wearable sensor technologies, translate surrogate task performance to operational outcomes, develop approaches to distinguish tasks and individual state and intent of
movement, establish database of human movement variability to inform intelligent system design, and identify high impact applications of augmentation.
Work in this Project supports key Army needs and leverages the technical research of several Program Elements (PEs) to include PE 0602143A (Soldier Lethality
Technology) / Project BC2 (Next Gen Mobility & Lethality Tech for Warfighters) and Project BC6 (Human Perf - Tech for Warfighter Enhancement); and supports PE
0603118A (Soldier Lethality Advanced Technology) / Project BC1 (Human Performance AdvTech for Mobility & Lethality). Additionally, work in this Project complements
and is fully coordinated with the Medical Research and Development Command under the Military Operational Medicine Research Program within PE 0602787A
(Medical Technology) / Project MK4 (Warfighter Health Applied Research Technology), and the Veteran Administration's exoskeleton research area. This Project also
complements and is fully coordinated with work performed across Army, Navy, and Air Force under the Reliance 21 Human Systems Community of Interest: Protection,
Sustainment, and Warfighter Performance and with our international partners through The Technical Cooperation Program / Human Resources and Performance
Group / Panel JP1 (TTCP HUM JP1).
The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
This Project funds the research and investigation of component technologies to enhance cargo and personnel airdrop capabilities for global precision delivery, rapid
deployment, and insertion for force projection into hostile regions. Areas of emphasis include parachute technologies, parachutist injury reduction, precision offset aerial
delivery, soft landing technologies, and airdrop simulation. Technologies support the Soldier Lethality Army Modernization Priority. New operational concepts call for
increased precision of personnel and cargo in austere environments in which small units are dispersed and logistical supply is limited. The Army requires enhanced
payload extraction and other increased capabilities to support the airdrop requirement for current and future vehicles exceeding aircraft payload weight capacity.
Work in this Project supports key Army needs and complements the technical research of several Program Elements (PEs) to include PE 0601102A (Defense Research
Sciences), PE 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology) / Project BD6 (Soldier Sys Interfaces/ Integration- Sensor Tech), and PE 0603118A (Soldier Lethality Advanced
Technology) / Project BE5 (Personnel & Airdrop Safety Advanced Technology).
The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.
Work in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC).

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
This research investigates and develops standoff robotic capabilities for Combat Engineers to reduce Soldier/Engineer risks and fatalities while conducting activities
essential to shaping the environment. It will close the gaps between commercial construction equipment and the requirements of the future Engineer Force to support
maneuver, movement, and sustainment. This research will develop the capability to generate a near real-time site model with appropriate engineering details to allow
unmanned shaping of the environment through physical interaction (e.g. push, pull, lift, or dig). This effort will also develop the requisite mission planner and task
execution controller that accepts input from the user and provides suggestions and feedback based on updates to the site model, reporting from hardware agents, and
resource allocation logic. The end state goal is the development of beyond visual line of sight teleoperation and semiautonomous capabilities allowing Engineer robotic
support to match pace in near term and future combat environments. This effort will support the development, testing, and evaluation of prototypical robotic Combat
Engineer equipment. This Project develops modeling and simulation tools that represent realistic states for Engineer robotic operations and develops and assesses
semi-autonomous and autonomous construction equipment technologies needed for remote control Engineer operations.
Work in this Project complements Program Element (PE) 0603119A (Ground Advanced Technology) / Project BK8 (Robotics for Engineer Operations Adv Tech).
The work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.
Work in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Ground Portfolio.
Work in this Project is coordinated with Program Element (PE) 0603462A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology).

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
This Project will develop safer alternative technologies that enable Army readiness, support supply chain resilience, improve Soldier and worker safety and reduce
environmental impacts, including reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The Project investigates alternatives for cross-cutting materials, undergoing or threatened
by regulatory scrutiny, found in ground vehicles and all other types of Army weapon systems. Research areas of focus include alloys, ceramics, composites, textiles,
maintenance fluids, propellants, explosives, and pyrotechnics. This work addresses increasing threats to readiness associated with carcinogenic, toxic, and restricted
materials such as lead, beryllium, perchlorates, volatile organic compounds and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) (forever chemicals), which can diminish
Soldier and community health, restrict training and interrupt critical maintenance activities. Future liabilities and risks are characterized early in the life cycle of material
development to ensure truly sustainable alternatives. This Project also investigates, develops and designs technologies to allow Soldiers to rapidly prioritize risk for
PFAS to enable informed, timely and cost-effective solutions.
The cited work is consistent with the Army Modernization Strategy and provides enabling technologies in support of all Cross Functional Teams.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
This Project designs capabilities for reduced vehicle crew sizes to successfully operate a larger number of closed-hatch manned and remote unmanned vehicles in
a complex multi-domain operations environment. This Project will enable future crews to perform complex missions with increasingly sophisticated technologies, and
in increasingly complex, dynamic socio-technical environments. The applied research will provide the fundamental technologies to enable integrated performanceimproved Learning - Warfighter Machine Interfaces (WMIs) that are scalable to multiple crew hardware and functional configurations; reconfigurable frameworks and
simulation for concept experimentation and exploration; and team-centered dynamic tasking by machine intelligence to effectively utilize full capabilities of crew and
technologies. The research will generate soldier-informed data, reports, and analysis to support operational use in future vehicles through soldier experimentation and
assessment of technical concepts in simulation and in-field WMIs. The capabilities created by this research will lead to increased overall crew and team performance;
improved soldier safety due to fewer soldier per vehicle, closed-hatch operations, and improved standoff from effective control; and vehicles that can effectively perform
across multiple domains of battle.
The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
This Project develops and characterizes artificial intelligence and machine learning software and algorithms to team with soldiers in support of fully autonomous
maneuver of the Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) and other autonomous systems, both physical and non-embodied. Efforts develop capabilities for NGCV and
other autonomous agents that increase autonomy, unburdening the soldier operator, with a high degree of survivability and lethality in a highly contested environment.
This work also investigates power distribution and conversion technologies to provide compact, efficient, and high power capabilities for electrical and electromechanical loads supporting both mobile and stationary unmanned platforms. Research enables combat vehicles to rapidly learn, adapt, and reason faster than
the adversary; accomplish missions in contested, austere and congested environments, characterized by lack of structure, adversarial actions, and minimal a priori
knowledge; and provide force reduction through self-learning vehicles that can operate in complex militarily relevant environments. This Project also matures emerging
research leading to potential technology development in areas of strategic importance to the Army by bringing competitively selected Universities with research teams
into Technical Alliances.
The cited work is consistent with Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.
Work in this Project is performed by the United States (US) Army Futures Command.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
This Project addresses sustainment operations by unburdening the Soldier and reducing logistics requirements (e.g., fewer batteries) for communications, computing,
and sensing. The objective is to improve the underlying energy efficiency of supply and demand for Soldier-portable and distributed sensor electronics to enable the
dismounted Soldier to maintain communications, freedom of movement, and increase mission duration. The majority of the electronics power used by the dismounted
Soldier and by distributed electronics is attributable to radio frequency (RF) communications. In addition, freedom of movement and action during sustained and high
tempo operations requires seamless battery recharging. To address these challenges, energy efficient electronics research includes RF and optoelectronic circuits,
devices, materials and wireless power (and data) transfer.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
This Project develops and characterizes machine learning and artificial intelligence methods for processing, analysis and provisioning control of smart, distributed,
networked sensors and devices. It provides situational understanding and decision support to enable fast, adaptive and interoperable Command, Control,
Communications and intelligence (C3I) network-integrated applications, resilient to adversarial activity in contested and complex environments. Effective use of
distributed networked sensors, autonomous agents and automated decision support tools is critical to address threats posed by peer competitors and more capable
asymmetric forces, particularly in complex environments where traditional sensors provide an incomplete understanding of the tactical situation due to adversarial
activity, occluded sightlines and small fields of regard.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
This Project develops tactical atmospheric sensing, modeling, and decision support technologies. New atmospheric sensing technologies are developed that enable
near-real-time, high-resolution measurements of atmospheric parameters via light-weight systems that can be employed in tactical domains. Efforts include highresolution local assessments and forecasts of meteorological conditions that can accommodate the effects of dense urban and complex, mountainous terrain. Both
physics-based and rule-based decision support systems are developed for assessing the impacts of weather/atmosphere across a spectrum of friendly and threat
weapons systems, sensors, platforms, and operations. It provides detailed model applications for various effects of the atmosphere on electro-optical and acoustic target
detection, location, and identification. Information can be applied to mission planning and execution, battlefield visualization, reconnaissance, surveillance, and target
acquisition, route planning to maximize stealth and efficiency, web-enabled tactical decision aids, long-range precision fires, and modeling of environmental impacts for
combat simulations and war games.
This work provides technologies for evaluation by and/or transitions to the Department of Defense weather and operations community including: Program Executive
Office (PEO) Ammunition-PM Combat Ammunition Systems (CAS) and Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) for meteorological message input to field artillery
targeting systems, Project Manager, Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A), the United States Air Force 557th Weather Wing, and the Air Force Life
Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) to improve their operational weather support to the Army.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
This Project develops technologies that will enable precise and assured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) in Global Positioning System (GPS)-denied
environments by addressing the PNT's toughest Scenario - Scenario 4 (no available GPS signal during the mission duration) with a goal of enabling Soldier missions
of up to seven days in a GPS denied environment. This is achieved by researching advanced quantum timing circuits, advanced inertial measurement unit (IMU)
components, multi-sensor modalities, perception techniques, geo-location data, vision aided navigation sensors, and available radio frequency (RF) signals.
This work also addresses the PNT Scenario 1 (GPS operations that start well and have degraded GPS signals throughout the mission duration) through Scenario 3
(GPS operations that have bad or limited availability of GPS signals throughout the entire mission). This is achieved by investigating the ability to transmit jam- resistant,
precision timing synchronized signals using optical fibers, free-space using lasers, and in the RF domain using innovative RF antenna concepts to extend the reach of
Soldier compatible capabilities in heavily contested GPS environments.
Work in this Project complements Program Element (PE) 0603463A (Network C3I Advanced Technology) / Project AW6 (Modular GPS Independent Sensors Advanced
Tech) and Program Element (PE) 0602146A (Network C3I Technology) / Project AW5 (Modular GPS Independent Sensors Technology).

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
Tactical Land Component Forces require access to Space and High Altitude (HA) capabilities to enable force projection and maneuver during Multi-Domain Operations
(MDO). The capability need is documented in the Abbreviated Capability Description Document (A-CDD) for Middle Tier Acquisition for Army Tactical Space Layer which
was validated on 17 April 2021 and in the Combatant Command Integrated Priority Lists under the following Gap Identification numbers: 2021-SPACE COMMAND-11
(SPACECOM) for Positioning Navigation and Timing (PNT) Resilience; 2021-SPACECOM-12 for Persistent Intelligence and Reconnaissance (ISR) for Mobile Counter
Space System Defeat; and 2021 NORTHERN COMMAND-22 for PNT. Space and HA payloads provide persistent/deep sensing to increase the number of actionable
targets, decrease target discovery time, extend the range of Army sensing capabilities, improve commander's situational understanding of the Electromagnetic Spectrum
and enable lethal and non-lethal fires, and increase/accelerate improved MDO data to assist Commander's decision making process.
Project designs and develops technologies for Space-Based and HA applications to support Army tactical ground forces. Focus is on advanced technology development
in support of Army objectives for Joint Operating Environment 2035. Investigations conducted leverage other Department of Defense (DoD) space science and
technology applications to support Army space force enhancement and cooperative satellite payload development. Efforts include, but not limited to, research to mature
current technologies in quantum sciences based communications, sensing, and data teleportation for small spacecraft and high altitude applications.
Work in this Project complements PE 0603463A (Network C3I Advanced Technology) / Project CJ8 (Assured PNT Communications Advanced Tech).
The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
This Project develops techniques to accelerate decision-making at lower echelons where data, information systems (IS), and Soldiers are distributed across complex
and hostile environments. With robust multi-modal distributed information analytics and adaptive information mediation, decision makers can share understanding across
echelons through a cross-reality information interaction. Research focuses on operational issues and gaps concerning decision uncertainty, at-the-edge situational
awareness/understanding, and secure low-Size, Weight, and Power (SWAP) IS that support converged capabilities. These capabilities are critical in overcoming
limitations in traditional uni-modal machine learning architectures that depend on extensive training data and stove-piped Command and Control systems that cannot
provide a shared, adaptive common operating picture across echelons.
Work in this Project complements Program Element (PE) 0603462 (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology) / Project BF4 (Combat Vehicle Robotics
Adv Tech) and Program Element (PE) 0603463 (Network C3I Advanced Technology) / Project AQ8 (High Tempo Data Driven Decision Tools Adv Tech).

Description: This effort develops Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) approaches for providing Situational Awareness
(SA) across echelons that are robust to compromised, corrupted, or limited data and networks in contested and unpredictable
battlespace environments. These approaches will provide increased probability of discernment of true vs. false targets, and
incorporate uncertainty-aware neuro-symbolic AI/ML to calibrate confidence in algorithm predictions. Research will incorporate
multimodal analysis with multi-view scene understanding from heterogeneous sensor systems for context-aware inference,
utilize transfer learning techniques to bridge domain gap between real and synthetic data for improved machine learning, and
employ Size, Weight and Power-Time (SWaP-T) constrained processing at the edge on emerging low power secure compute
architectures through neural network pruning and compression. Simulations of Command and Control (C2) strategies will
incorporate the MDIA approaches.

sets on small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs); develop synthetic data generation approaches to generate inherently labeled
synthetic electro-optical infrared (EO/IR) data of vehicles and dismounts to substantially augment the limited availability of real
training data; validate the AiTR algorithms using collected field data; investigate algorithm-architecture co-optimization frameworks
with Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to increase neural network inference speed through optimal algorithm mapping to
hardware; explore how machine learning algorithms implemented on size, weight, power and cost (SWaP-C) constrained devices

Description: This effort will deliver advanced airborne optics and reconfigurable filtering devices to enable agile, multitask sensors for compact, long-range targeting, enhanced survivability and lethality of the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) and
Future Unmanned Aircraft System (FUAS). This effort will restore visual overmatch in any (day/night) environment through
visual penetration of all obscurants (e.g. brownout, white out, engineered smokescreens) from a single sensor, as well as
narrowband filtering for active imaging through obscurants while maintaining advanced target acquisition. Improved detection and
identification and long range target acquisition capability will result from filtering out scattered light and enabling 3-dimensional
ranging through environmental obscurants.
FY 2023 Plans:
Conduct experiments on the efficacy, performance, and durability of newly available optical materials. Validate optical
performance of field-selectable spectral bandpass filters to determine impacts to multiple tasks needed in a dynamic airborne
environment. Mature optical lens material manufacturability of novel dual-band crystalline materials for use in advanced targeting
applications. Conduct experiments to determine the range resolution achievable for day/night airborne active 3-D imaging.
FY 2024 Plans:
Will validate the new dual band infrared (IR) optical material in a relevant lens design; enabling lower size, weight, and power cost (SWaP-C), improved durability, and dual-band flexibility. Will develop a compact and lightweight optical design, and novel

Note
AI Development Environment Applied Research is a new start within the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Technologies program in FY 2024.
A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
The Army lacks a common platform to develop AI/ML. This results in siloed and duplicative work that is inefficient. Many current solutions have narrow application and
are proprietary, requiring additional funding, time, and labor for even minor modifications. The AI-enabled Army of the future will require low cost, rapid AI/ML solutions
at the edge. This project will design and develop a set of platform(s), and infrastructure optimized for Army use and ready for rapid employment in enterprise, multi,
and hybrid cloud environments to support?modular software (cloud native) intended to continuously develop and integrate AI/ML models. It will design and develop
hardware and software technologies, including cloud native applications and infrastructure for globally dispersed AI/ML development collaboration, artifact sharing,
automated resource provisioning, and continuous ML Operations. The AI Development Environment will provide the AI-enabled Army of the future with low cost, rapid
AI/ML solutions at the edge and accelerated algorithm development for faster delivery to the field.as well as less expensive AI/ML development by leveraging shared
resources.?
The cited research is consistent with Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

sensor networks to extract critical environmental information optimizing performance and reducing the need for dedicated meteorological sensors. Novel physics-based
models, empirical parameterizations, and machine learning applications extrapolate this environmental information both spatially and temporally. Uncertainty-aware
decision support tools leverage this situational awareness to efficiently express atmospheric effects on friendly and threat weapons systems, sensors, and operations
at the point of need and across multiple domains. This information can be exploited by autonomous and human decision makers for mission planning and execution;
battlefield visualization; reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition; route planning to maximize stealth and efficiency; long-range precision fires; and modeling
of environmental impacts for combat simulations and war games.
This work provides technologies for evaluation by and/or transitions to the Department of Defense weather and operations community including: Program Executive
Office (PEO) Ammunition-Program Manager (PM) Combat Ammunition Systems (CAS) and Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) for meteorological message input
to field artillery targeting systems, PM Intelligence Systems and Analytics (DCGS-A), and the US Air Force 557th Weather Wing to improve their operational weather
support to the Army.
The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.
Work in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command.

of unconventional spectrum and techniques for covert communications; explore the integration of developed covert networking
techniques with multi-domain technical effects; investigate the use of game theory approaches to achieve cyber misrepresentation
on tactical networks; build attack graphs to comprehend the interdependencies among vulnerabilities and to analyze the attacker's
potential course of action; use game theory for an optimum decoy allocation framework that causes network reconnaissance to be
difficult, allows detection of an attacker, and detains the attacker.
FY 2024 Plans:
Will investigate radio-frequency low-probability-of-detection techniques and network-level metrics for hybrid coding and diversity
approaches to covert communications; develop protocols for and conduct experiments on hybrid radio-frequency/ultraviolet
communications networks; develop methods that build asymmetric advantages for defenders over intelligent, near-peer
adversaries, to deal with dynamic environments and fast changing mission context that results in uncertainties and partial

Description: Establish improved experimentally validated modeling tools and methodologies that can be used to understand the
physics of aeroelastic stability and design in next generation rotorcraft platform configurations for FVL platforms. This involves
the development of an experimental capability, the Tiltrotor Aeroelastic Stability Test (TRAST), which will be used to generate
novel experimental data. This data will be used to increase fundamental understanding of the whirl flutter instability, which
currently limits the high speed performance of tiltrotor rotorcraft. This effort will inform FVL requirement definition and technology
maturation. This effort also establishes low noise rotor concepts and investigates the intersection of artificial intelligence and
classical mechanics to enable novel mechanics and new approaches in structural dynamics for FVL applications to enable higher
Operating Tempo (OPTEMPO) operations.
FY 2023 Plans:
Experimentally and analytically explore active control technologies for tiltrotor aeroelastic stability augmentation and performance
improvement to enable lighter, higher speed, and higher range tiltrotor aircraft. Investigate aerodynamic interactions between
closely spaced airfoil elements and their potential to reduce boundary layer height and separation, thus reducing broadband noise.
Validate a rotor using this effect to achieve a reduced noise signature through high fidelity simulations and experiments. Develop

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
This Project investigates research gaps related to human and intelligent systems to enhance decision making in response to changing conditions. Applied research is
conducted on novel and emerging visualization technologies as well as methodologies for intelligent systems and Soldier to co-adapt for the real-time quantification,
prediction, and enhancement of squad-level shared situational awareness (SA) and situational understanding (SU) across dynamic, complex, and uncertain operating
environments, leading to demonstrated increases in mission effectiveness. The result of this Project will inform various efforts that rely on human and intelligent system
interactions including systems that adapt the behavior of autonomous assets and intelligent Soldier tools, based on dynamic needs of the Soldier/squad, using real-time
opportunistic measures of Soldier SA and changing mission environment. In addition, this Project will design novel approaches to represent uncertain and dynamically
changing information, to increase Soldier comprehension and enhanced mission effectiveness, with reduced Soldier/squad burden and training requirements.
The cited research is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.
Research in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC).

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
This Project conducts applied research to provide critical breakthroughs in developing a "technologically" fluent force. This research will develop models of technological
fluency(TF) (TF Modeling), methods and measures to assess and develop the technological fluency of Soldiers across a career (TF Personnel Assessments), and
technologies to maximize technological fluency resilience and performance in Soldiers and units (Maximizing TF). TF is defined as the ability of Soldiers and units to use
and rapidly adapt new and intelligent technologies without formal training on these technologies, and it will be a decisive factor in a future operating environment in which
Soldiers and squads are teamed with increasingly sophisticated and evolving technologies. Soldiers and leaders in specialty areas (e.g., Cyber and Emerging Tech) and
General Purpose Forces will require increased technological aptitudes and skills to adapt emerging technologies to evolving mission sets and avoid being overmatched
by Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled "smart" technologies.
This Project supports key Army needs and will coordinate with and/or leverage findings of several Program Elements (PEs) to include PE 0602785A (Manpower,
Personnel and Training Technology), 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology), and 0602145A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Technology).
This research will be performed collaboratively by the Combat Capability Development Command - Army Research Laboratory (ARL) and the United States (U.S.) Army
Research Institute (ARI) for Behavioral and Social Sciences.
The cited research is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas, the Army Modernization Strategy, and the Army
People Strategy.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
This Program Element (PE) supports application of knowledge gained through basic research to refine drugs, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics, medical practices/
procedures, and other preventive measures essential to the protection and sustainment of Warfighter health. Research is conducted in five principal areas: Combat
Casualty Care, Military Operational Medicine, Military Relevant Infectious Diseases, Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine, Medical Capabilities to Support Dispersed
Operations, and Systems Biology/Network Sciences. Projects are coordinated with the Defense Health Agency.
The cited research is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization
Strategy.
Work in this Program element (PE) is performed by the United States Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC), Fort Detrick, MD.
All medical applied research is conducted in compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The FDA
requires thorough testing in animals (preclinical testing) to ensure safety and, where possible, effectiveness prior to evaluation in controlled human clinical trials (upon
transition to Advanced Technology Development). This PE focuses on research and refinement of technologies such as product formulation and purification and
laboratory test refinement with the aim of identifying candidate solutions. This work often involves testing in animal models. The EPA also requires thorough testing
of products, such as sterilants, disinfectants, repellents, and insecticides to ensure the environment is adequately protected before these products are licensed for
use. Program refinement and execution is externally peer-reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology
Coordinating Groups of the Biomedical Community of Interest. The Biomedical Community of Interest, formed under the authority of the Assistant Secretary of Defense
for Research and Engineering, serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defenses (DoD) biomedical
research community, as well as their associated enabling research areas.
